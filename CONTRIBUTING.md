# Contribute
So now you're here, wanting to learn how to contribute. That's great, you came to the right place! Projects are better with
more contributors to improve the source code such as less lines, faster performance and higher security.

## Getting Started
Make sure you [sign up](https://github.com/join) for an account at Github if you don't have one. 
Otherwise, [log in](https://github.com/login) into your account. Once you've finished that, squash some bugs! 
- If you don't know how to write code, please [submit an issue ticket](https://github.com/codynguyen1116/brickimedia-design-guide/issues) to the project.
- If you do know how to write code, we encourage you to submit a pull request to help fix or improve anything.

## How to: Pull requests
- Write a short title of what your commit is about so other people will understand.
- If needed, write a description with it if a short title is not enough.

Want to learn more? Read on further on the [GitHub help article](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

# Issues
- Provide constructive feedback and be polite to others while commenting! 
- If it's a bug, include the browser and version, your operating system, and what kind of device (PC, tablet, or phone?).
- If you're a collaborator (a user with commit access), then add a label to the issue for organizing.
- Keep issues in the project scope. As long as they're relevant (such as improving performance, covering security holes, etc), they're gladly welcomed.
- Include a screenshot of what's happening.

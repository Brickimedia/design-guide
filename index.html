			<h1>About the Draft</h1>
			<p>This is a work-in-progress draft created for Brickimedia, an online LEGO community. We want to improve the experience for users by  making navigation more fluid, simplifying the appearance, along with providing the same feeling for users with different devices. Our principle focuses on design without distractions. No more squnting your eyes to read texts with a miniscule font size, or scrolling your screen to look at the stuff overflowing the webpage. Your priority is our priority.<p>
